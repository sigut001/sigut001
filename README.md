### Hi, I'm Simon Guth ðŸ‘‹

I'm a 29-year-old Software Developer with a background in Mechanical Engineering. Initially trained as an engineer, I worked at the Fraunhofer Institute and later spent some time as an independent food retailer. However, my true passion has always been software development, which I pursued autodidactically in parallel to my other ventures.

I transitioned into the tech world, developing a broad skill set, and now focus on **web development** and **software engineering**. My journey as a self-taught developer began when I joined **Gruppe AI**, where I gained my first professional experiences. Since then, Iâ€™ve been working as a freelancer and am still contributing to the **OmniView** open-source project.

### My Strengths:
- **Frontend Development**: I have extensive experience with **Angular**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **Angular Material**, and I consistently focus on creating responsive and scalable web applications.  
- **Backend Development**: Skilled with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **Firebase Functions** to create powerful server-side applications.
- **Cloud and Serverless**: Well-versed in using **Firebase** and **Google APIs**, especially when building serverless solutions.
- **Version Control & CI/CD**: Strong proficiency with **Git** and **GitHub Actions** to streamline development workflows, ensuring seamless collaboration across teams.
- **State Management & Performance Optimization**: Proficient in using **NGRX** for state management, along with techniques like **Lazy Loading**, **Tree Shaking**, and **Code Splitting** to optimize app performance.

### Current & Future Projects:
At present, Iâ€™m focused on improving my skills in areas like **MySQL**, **API design (OpenAPI)**, and **Python**. I'm also expanding my knowledge in **Monorepos (NX)** and diving deeper into cloud-native applications using tools like **Firebase** and **Serverless Architectures**.

My goal for the next two years is to transform my freelance work into a full-fledged business by founding my own **web development agency**, where I can help clients build tailored web solutions.

I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations. If you're looking for a **freelance developer** or need help with your next **web project**, feel free to reach out!
